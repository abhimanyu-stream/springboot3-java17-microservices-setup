Components of Abstract Factory Design Pattern

1. Abstract Product: This represents the interface of the products that the abstract factory creates. It defines a set of operations that concrete products must implement.
2. Concrete Product: These are the actual product implementations created by concrete factories. Each concrete factory creates a different variant of the product by implementing the abstract product interface.
3. Abstract Factory: This is the main interface that declares a set of creation methods for creating the abstract products. It serves as a contract for concrete factories to implement. The abstract factory typically represents a family of related products.
4. Concrete Factory: These are the implementations of the abstract factory interface. Each concrete factory is responsible for creating a specific set of products, which are compatible within a specific variation or family.




To implement the Abstract Factory Pattern for creating Product class objects in a Spring Boot application, we can follow these steps:

1. Define the Product Interface or abstract class: This will serve as the base for all product types.
2. Create Concrete Product Classes: These classes will implement the Product interface.
3. Define the Abstract Factory Interface: This will declare methods for creating product objects.
4. Create Concrete Factories: Each factory will implement the abstract factory interface to produce a specific type of product.
5. Client Code: Use the factories to create product objects.
